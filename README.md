    <h1>Delivery Time Prediction Project</h1>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project aims to design a machine learning model for predicting delivery times, improving the accuracy of estimated delivery times, and providing practical benefits to both customers and vendors. With the growing use of delivery services, this project addresses the gap between estimated and actual delivery times using various predictive models.</p>
    
<h2>Background</h2>
    <h3>Problem Definition</h3>
    <p>Inconsistent delivery time estimates provided by delivery apps can lead to customer dissatisfaction and harm the reputation of vendors.</p>
    
  <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>The objective is to analyze key variables affecting delivery times and design a prediction model to provide more accurate delivery estimates.</p>
    
  <h2>Models and Techniques Used</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Linear Regression</li>
        <li>Ridge Regression</li>
        <li>Lasso Regression</li>
        <li>Elastic Net Regression</li>
        <li>Ensemble Model (Random Forest)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Each model's performance was evaluated, focusing on hyperparameter optimization. The Random Forest model demonstrated the best performance.</p>
    
  <h2>Data Overview and Preprocessing</h2>
  <h3>Data Collection</h3>
  <p>The data was gathered from kaggle, including key variables such as traffic congestion, delivery personnel information, food type, and seasonal factors.</p>
    
  <h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Handling missing values and outliers.</li>
        <li>Variable transformation and scaling.</li>
        <li>Analyzing relationships between variables through visualization.</li>
    </ul>
    
  <h2>Conclusions and Implications</h2>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The Random Forest model demonstrated superior performance in predicting delivery times. This improvement can enhance customer and vendor satisfaction by increasing the accuracy of delivery time estimates.</p>
    
  <h3>Future Directions</h3>
   <ul>
        <li>Expanding the dataset to analyze more variables.</li>
        <li>Applying deep learning techniques to improve model performance.</li>
        <li>Exploring real-time data integration possibilities.</li>
    </ul>
